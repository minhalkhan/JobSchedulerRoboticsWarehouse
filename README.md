# Job Scheduler Robotics Warehouse

A job scheduler (due to jobs being cancelled when picked up or when picked up, the job of the scheduler was to minimise this to improve productivity of the robots). This was done by training a Bayesian model on a list of previous jobs which were successful/cancelled to get the posterior probability of a selected job being cancelled.
